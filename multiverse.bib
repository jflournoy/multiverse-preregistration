  abstract = {Early adolescence is marked by puberty, and is also a time of flux in self-perception. However, there is limited research on the neural correlates of self-evaluation in relation to pubertal development. The current study examined relationships between neural activation during self-evaluation of social traits and maturation (age and pubertal development) in a community sample of female adolescents. Participants (N\,=\,143; age M\,=\,11.65, range\,=\,10.0\textendash 13.0) completed a functional MRI task in which they judged the self-descriptiveness of adjectives for prosocial, antisocial and social status-related traits. Pubertal development was based on self-report, and was also examined using morning salivary testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and estradiol. Contrary to preregistered hypotheses, neither age nor pubertal development were related to neural activation during self-evaluation. We further examined whether activation in two regions-of-interest, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and perigenual anterior cingulate (pgACC), was associated with trial-level self-evaluative behavior. In line with preregistered hypotheses, higher vmPFC and pgACC activation during self-evaluation were both associated with a higher probability of endorsing negative adjectives, and a lower probability of endorsing positive adjectives. Future studies should examine neural trajectories of self-evaluation longitudinally, and investigate the predictive value of the neural correlates of self-evaluation for adolescent mental health.},

  abstract = {Abstract (full): Correctly measuring and operationalizing pubertal processes during development is important for capturing variation in both normative development and trajectories associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of the current study was to understand how this variance may be captured by different pubertal processes (adrenarche and gonadarche) and how multiple methods may contribute to variance (and how they are correlated). The study explored multi-method cross-sectional pubertal data, including self-reported physical characteristics from the Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) and Morris \& Udry line drawings, and levels of hormones dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), and estradiol (E2) in saliva and hair, from a cohort of 174 early adolescent girls aged 10-13 years. Authors developed a theory-driven structural equation modelling framework of puberty for girls that includes multiple measures of puberty and considers both processes of adrenarche and gonadarche. Self-reported puberty and hormone levels from saliva and hair can estimate an overall pubertal process as well as each process of adrenarche and gonadarche. The self-reported PDS item on height growth had the lowest standardized loading of the self-report items. In full models with all measures, the more parsimonious one-factor model was not a significantly worse fit than the two-factor model. The shared variance between the hormonal latent puberty factor and the self-reported latent puberty factor was 32\%. This suggests fairly good reliability between hormones and self-report puberty data but also suggests that measuring puberty via hormones and via self-report questionnaires is not entirely redundant, and models of puberty require collecting both. Exploratory analyses showed 34\%, 48\%, and 52\% shared variance between chronological age and the adrenarcheal, gonadarcheal, and overall pubertal factors, respectively, suggesting that there is additional variance in these pubertal processes that is not explained by age alone. When controlling for age, the adrenarcheal and gonadarcheal factors were still strongly associated (90\% shared variance), suggesting that these factors are correlated when calculated as pubertal timing (i.e., stage compared to same-age peers), as well. Finally, correlations with age were higher when using the latent factors, whether for self-report questionnaire data alone, or for hormones, and correlations were highest when using all available self-report and biological measures.  Abstract (short): This structural equation modelling study explored how variance in pubertal development is captured by different processes (adrenarche and gonadarche) and methods, using cross-sectional pubertal data from a cohort of 174 early adolescent girls aged 10-13 years. Self-reported puberty and hormone levels from saliva and hair can estimate an overall pubertal process as well as each process of adrenarche and gonadarche. The self-reported PDS item on height growth had the lowest standardized loading of the self-report items. Hormonal and self-reported latent puberty factors had 32\% shared variance, suggesting that research should collect both. There was 34\%, 48\%, and 52\% shared variance between chronological age and the adrenarcheal, gonadarcheal, and pubertal factors, respectively, suggesting these processes are not explained by age alone.},

  abstract = {Many students, especially in econometrics, express frustration with the way a problem known as ``bad control'' is evaded, if not mishandled, in the traditional literature. The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this ``crash course'' accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

  abstract = {Decisions made by researchers while analyzing data (e.g., how to measure variables, how to handle outliers) are sometimes arbitrary, without an objective justification for choosing one alternative over another. Multiverse-style methods (e.g., specification curve, vibration of effects) estimate an effect across an entire set of possible specifications to expose the impact of hidden degrees of freedom and/or obtain robust, less biased estimates of the effect of interest. However, if specifications are not truly arbitrary, multiverse-style analyses can produce misleading results, potentially hiding meaningful effects within a mass of poorly justified alternatives. So far, a key question has received scant attention: How does one decide whether alternatives are arbitrary? We offer a framework and conceptual tools for doing so. We discuss three kinds of a priori nonequivalence among alternatives\textemdash measurement nonequivalence, effect nonequivalence, and power/precision nonequivalence. The criteria we review lead to three decision scenarios: Type E decisions (principled equivalence), Type N decisions (principled nonequivalence), and Type U decisions (uncertainty). In uncertain scenarios, multiverse-style analysis should be conducted in a deliberately exploratory fashion. The framework is discussed with reference to published examples and illustrated with the help of a simulated data set. Our framework will help researchers reap the benefits of multiverse-style methods while avoiding their pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Analysing data from experiments is a complex, multi-step process, often with multiple defensible choices available at each step. While analysts often report a single analysis without documenting how it was chosen, this can cause serious transparency and methodological issues. To make the sensitivity of analysis results to analytical choices transparent, some statisticians and methodologists advocate the use of `multiverse analysis': reporting the full range of outcomes that result from all combinations of defensible analytic choices. Summarizing this combinatorial explosion of statistical results presents unique challenges; several approaches to visualizing the output of multiverse analyses have been proposed across a variety of fields (e.g. psychology, statistics, economics, neuroscience). In this article, we (1) introduce a consistent conceptual framework and terminology for multiverse analyses that can be applied across fields; (2) identify the tasks researchers try to accomplish when visualizing multiverse analyses and (3) classify multiverse visualizations into `archetypes', assessing how well each archetype supports each task. Our work sets a foundation for subsequent research on developing visualization tools and techniques to support multiverse analysis and its reporting.},
