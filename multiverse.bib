  abstract = {Many students, especially in econometrics, express frustration with the way a problem known as ``bad control'' is evaded, if not mishandled, in the traditional literature. The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this ``crash course'' accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

  abstract = {Decisions made by researchers while analyzing data (e.g., how to measure variables, how to handle outliers) are sometimes arbitrary, without an objective justification for choosing one alternative over another. Multiverse-style methods (e.g., specification curve, vibration of effects) estimate an effect across an entire set of possible specifications to expose the impact of hidden degrees of freedom and/or obtain robust, less biased estimates of the effect of interest. However, if specifications are not truly arbitrary, multiverse-style analyses can produce misleading results, potentially hiding meaningful effects within a mass of poorly justified alternatives. So far, a key question has received scant attention: How does one decide whether alternatives are arbitrary? We offer a framework and conceptual tools for doing so. We discuss three kinds of a priori nonequivalence among alternatives\textemdash measurement nonequivalence, effect nonequivalence, and power/precision nonequivalence. The criteria we review lead to three decision scenarios: Type E decisions (principled equivalence), Type N decisions (principled nonequivalence), and Type U decisions (uncertainty). In uncertain scenarios, multiverse-style analysis should be conducted in a deliberately exploratory fashion. The framework is discussed with reference to published examples and illustrated with the help of a simulated data set. Our framework will help researchers reap the benefits of multiverse-style methods while avoiding their pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Analysing data from experiments is a complex, multi-step process, often with multiple defensible choices available at each step. While analysts often report a single analysis without documenting how it was chosen, this can cause serious transparency and methodological issues. To make the sensitivity of analysis results to analytical choices transparent, some statisticians and methodologists advocate the use of `multiverse analysis': reporting the full range of outcomes that result from all combinations of defensible analytic choices. Summarizing this combinatorial explosion of statistical results presents unique challenges; several approaches to visualizing the output of multiverse analyses have been proposed across a variety of fields (e.g. psychology, statistics, economics, neuroscience). In this article, we (1) introduce a consistent conceptual framework and terminology for multiverse analyses that can be applied across fields; (2) identify the tasks researchers try to accomplish when visualizing multiverse analyses and (3) classify multiverse visualizations into `archetypes', assessing how well each archetype supports each task. Our work sets a foundation for subsequent research on developing visualization tools and techniques to support multiverse analysis and its reporting.},
