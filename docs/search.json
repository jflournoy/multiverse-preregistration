Within the template is a helpful guide for planning your analyses. The example is from a larger paper in progress using real developmental cognitive neuroimaging data. Finally, we provide a shiny app to showcase some of the results from this example."

Is there a construct that causes both the cause and effect of interest?\nAre there moderators of the cause’s impact on the effect, i.e., are there constructs that change how much the cause impacts the effect?\nIf you (and theory, and the literature) are uncertain about what role a construct plays, it is likely there are competing causal models.\nWrite out all reasonable, plausible, causal models. It may be helpful to create a diagram in a graphical program (InkScape, LucidChart, PowerPoint, Adobe Illustrator) or using the ggdag package in R."

    "text": "Some decision points invite comparisons between competing options that may be evaluated using existing statistical tools. In our preregistration example, we were interested in how pubertal development relates to neural activation during self-referential processing in the “social brain”. We started out identifying choice of region of interest in the social brain as a potential Type U decision. Does it matter whether we use data from ventro-medial prefrontal cortext (vmPFC) or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)? Instead of examining several different multiverses for each ROI to examine the robustness of the effect size or significance of our association of interest, we could test this question in a model-based way. This becomes an overarching research question upon which our primary question depends, and we can examine the robustness of the answer to this question across our multiverse of decisions.\n\nIs it possible to adjudicate between options in some Type U decisions using model comparison or other common statistical tools?\nList these Type U decisions.\nConsider amending sec. 1 in light of this new information."

    "text": "Using the above categories, Giudice and Gangestad (2021) suggest the following approach:\n\nType N: only the best option from non-equivalent decisions should be kept, in which case these decisions will not expand the set of analyses in the multiverse. In cases where the best option is not known (e.g., the correct causal model), it might make sense to examine the criterion (see below) for each option across separate multiverse analyses.\n\nType U: each option should be used to generate a separate multiverse.\nType E: the different possible combinations of options for these decisions will create the set of analayses for each multiverse.\n\nUsing the above organizational strategy, describe, your mutliverse. To get a sense of the size of the set of the analyses in the multiverse, multiply the number of options for each decision together. If there are two Type E decisions each with three options, and one Type U decision, with two options, we would have two separate multiverses, each with \\(3\\times 3 = 9\\) observations of the criterion.\nIt can be helpful to describe using language like\n\nWe will define a number of multiverses using the combination of Type U Factor I (3 options) and Type N Factor J (5 options), for a total of 10. Within each multiverse, analytic specifications comprise combinations of Type E Factor K (3 options), Factor L (2 options), and Factor Q (6 options) for a total of 36."
