If you are developing this analysis after a study has been designed and data collected, it may be the case that your particular data set does not instantiate all of the possible reasonable specifications. To optimize transparency, it can be useful in the registration and in subsequent analyses and reports to be able to speak to the portions of the multiverse not covered.\nThe steps below may not be fully linear! In other words, if you start at the top and work your way down, you may find yourself revisiting previous steps.

In our preregistration example, we were interested in how pubertal development relates to neural activation during self-referential processing in the “social brain”. We started out identifying choice of region of interest in the social brain as a potential Type U decision. Does it matter whether we use data from ventro-medial prefrontal cortext (vmPFC) or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)? Instead of examining several different multiverses for each ROI to examine the robustness of the effect size or significance of our association of interest, we could test this question in a model-based way. This becomes an overarching research question upon which our primary question depends, and we can examine the robustness of the answer to this question across our multiverse of decisions.\n\nIs it possible to adjudicate between options in some Type U decisions using model comparison or other common statistical tools?\nList these Type U decisions.\nConsider amending Section 1 in light of this new information."

In cases where the best option is not known (e.g., the correct causal model), it might make sense to examine the criterion (see below) for each option across separate multiverse analyses.\n\nType U: each option should be used to generate a separate multiverse.\nType E: the different possible combinations of options for these decisions will create the set of analayses for each multiverse.\n\nUsing the above organizational strategy, describe, your mutliverse. To get a sense of the size of the set of the analyses in the multiverse, multiply the number of options for each decision together. If there are two Type E decisions each with three options, and one Type U decision, with two options, we would have two separate multiverses, each with \\(3\\times 3 = 9\\) observations of the criterion.\nIt can be helpful to describe using language like\n\nWe will define a number of multiverses using the combination of Type U Factor I (3 options) and Type N Factor J (5 options), for a total of 10. Within each multiverse, analytic specifications comprise combinations of Type E Factor K (3 options), Factor L (2 options), and Factor Q (6 options) for a total of 36."
